For the first task, I created a grid for the cars, with green and black using rectangles.

In the second task, I created cars out of white squares from a class.I was then able to make an array for the cars and randomize the x and y for height and width. I also made the cars move to the right by the speed of 2. I was not able to get the cars to detect the corners and bounce off as needed.
